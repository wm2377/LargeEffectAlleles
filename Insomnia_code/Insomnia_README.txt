Here is the code to generate Supplementary Figures 1 through 4.

Fig S1 and Fig S2 require simulation results. These simulations are ran and processed using Snakemake (version 8). The figures are generated using Figure_S1_and_S2.ipynb jupyter notebook.

Fig S3 and Fig S4 do not require simulations and are solely based on analytical or numerical approximations.

Path names likely need to changed throughout to ensure these files could run on someone else's computer.

See conda_environment.json for a list of packages and versions used.
